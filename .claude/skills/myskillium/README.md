# Myskillium

Myskillium is a meta-skill within the Claude Code ecosystem that finds and improves skills using processes modelled after mycelium.  Through a process called conidiation it creates spores (conidium) that can be copied to other repos where they grow independently into hyphae (threads) and eventualy connect to create decentralized network of symbiotic cloned skills.

Examples of use:

   "Claude, find me a skill that can ....X....?"  
   "Claude, find a better version of this skill:  ...X.."
   "Claude, create a hybrid skill that combines the best elements of these two skills:  ...Y and Z..."

This experiment in non-deterministic evolutionary programming is dedicated to John Horton Conway, Edward Lorenz, Stephen Wolfram, and Andrej Karpathy.
