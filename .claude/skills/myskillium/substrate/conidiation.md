# Conidiation

## Skill Analogy

In the myskillium context, conidiation refers to the process of spreading via the portable installation script (`spore.py`). Just as mycelium use conidia to grow, conidiation is the process of myskillium to spread across repositories.

## Purpose

The conidium tool (`spore.py`) is a standalone script that can be copied into any repository to perform skill extraction without requiring the full myskillium skill to be present.

## Process

> **Status**: Not yet implemented

### Planned Workflow

1. **Package extraction logic** into portable Python script
2. **Include pedigree schema** for genealogy documentation
3. **Minimize dependencies** for maximum portability
4. **Version the spore** with its parent myskillium commit

### Output

```
myskillium-spore.py  # Portable extraction tool
```

## Relationship to Other Processes

| Process | Relationship |
|---------|-------------|
| Fragmentation | Uses the spore tool to perform extraction |
| Plasmogamy | Uses the spore tool to perform fusion |

The spore is the **mechanism**; fragmentation and plasmogamy are the **operations** that use it.
